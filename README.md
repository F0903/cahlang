# Cahlang

A basic interpreter for the custom joke programming language "cahlang".
Made purely for fun and learning. Don't expect this to work flawlessly.

Syntax:
**ritual** - Declares a function. End with the **end** keyword.
**offering** - Declares a variable. Assign a value with **=**.

For other things see the test.cah file.
