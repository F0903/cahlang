# TODO

To-Do list that is somewhat in order.

- [x] Implement changing the value of a variable.
- [x] Implement branching with "if" statements.
- [x] Comparison operators.
- [x] Add ability to add native functions.
- [x] Floats.
- [x] Implement loops.
- [ ] Function return values.
- [ ] Refactor (e.g. better internal error handling and custom error types)

## Ideas

- Perhaps covert to lexing and that whole ordeal instead of parsing raw text.
